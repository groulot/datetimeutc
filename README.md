#datetimeutc

## Because why are we dealing with timezones?

A lightweight datetime utility library which wraps around the standard datetime module, with features from dateutil, and pytz.

It's purpose is to minimize the effort to convert datetime to and from UTC, a task I found myself doing too often when building web services and social driven applications.
